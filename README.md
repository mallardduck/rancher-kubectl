# kubectl

And. That. Is. It.

## Adding new versions

1. `Add new versions` workflow will create a PR,
2. A `CODEOWNER` will need to review and approve the PR,
3. Upon review, the `Validate PR` workflow will run to meet merge requirements,
4. The PR can be merged after all checks pass,
5. Once merged, the `Publish Images` workflow will run:
    - Validates versions file,
    - Prebuild information collection,
    - Image's built with docker `buildx` action,
    - CPU arch specific tags published

### Merging PRs & Image Releases
Before a PR can be merged it must be:
- Reviewed and Approved by at least 1 user assigned in `CODEOWNERS`, 
- passing the `Check kubectl release versions` action.

## Digging Deeper

The source for the versions to create the images is in `versions.txt`.
This file is maintained by the scheduled [`add-new-veresions.yml`](./.github/workflows/check-new-versions.yml) workflow which automatically looks up new versions and creates a pull request.
Additionally, you can manually add entries to it or manually run the [GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflows/check-new-versions.yml) to create an automatic PR on-demand.

Scripts live in the `./scripts` directory:

- `add-new-versions.sh`: Checks GitHub releases for `kubernetes/kubernetes` with a version regex, checks if the image already exists, and if not, adds it to `versions.txt`.
- `check-versions.sh`: Checks if the binaries exists for all architectures for versions in `versions.txt`.
- `new-versions.sh`: Compares versions in `versions.txt` to filter out new versions into `new-versions.txt` temp file. (Based on existing image versions defined by `$EXISTING_VERSIONS` env variable.)
